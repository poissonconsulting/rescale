Description: Scales columns in a data frame based on the columns in
    a second data frame. For example a column can be centered by subtracting its mean
    and standardised by dividing by the standard deviation.
    The package was developed for making predictions based on models with
    centred and standardised variables.  For the predictions to be valid the
    new data frame must have its predictor variables centered and standardised
    based on the original data.
