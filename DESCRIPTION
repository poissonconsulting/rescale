Description: Rescales columns in a data frame based on the columns in
    a second data frame. For example a column can be rescaled by subtracting the mean
    and dividing by the standard deviation. The user can pass the names of functions which calculate 
    the value to subtract and/or the value to divide by.
    The package was developed for making predictions based on models with
    rescaled variables.  For the predictions to be valid the
    new data frame must have its predictor variables rescaled
    based on the original data.
