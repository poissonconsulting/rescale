Description: Centers and scales columns in a data frame based on the columns in
    a second data frame. A column is centered by subtracting the mean
    and scaled (after centering) by dividing by the standard deviation.
    The package was developed for making predictions based on models with
    centred and scaled variables.  For the predictions to be valid the
    new data frame must have its predictor variables centered and scaled
    based on the original data.
