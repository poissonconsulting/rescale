Description: Rescales columns in a data frame based on the columns in a
    second data frame. For example a column can be rescaled by subtracting
    the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The user can pass the
    names of functions which calculate the value to subtract and/or the
    value to divide by.  The package was developed for making predictions
    based on models with rescaled variables.  For the predictions to be
    valid the new data frame must have its predictor variables rescaled
    based on the original data.
